PHP Password Generator

This is a simple function to generate temporary passwords on PHP. The original idea was to have Microsoft Outlook 
like passwords that are easy to remember by users. This function generates passwords like:

    Juso9372
    Padi2834
    Tira4867
    
The function tries to omit some dirty words... you know, you don't want to tell your user "your password is F**k1234".
It is very easy to modify it and have it generate more complex passwords.
